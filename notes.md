# Graph_Visualizer

Visualizes various algorithms on a given input graph and animates them to show node traversal and edge traversal paths.

## Unweighted graphs

### BFS

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges in a graph systematically. Starting from a given node (known as the source node), BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This "level-by-level" approach makes BFS especially suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, as it guarantees reaching the nearest nodes first.

### DFS

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Starting from a specified node (called the source node), DFS dives deep into a graph, following one path until it reaches a dead end or an already visited node, then backtracks to explore other paths. This "depth-first" approach allows DFS to explore all nodes in a connected component or in a graph.
